Greetings!

I host my projects here, some of wich are finished and others are a work in progress.

I'm a recent University of California, Riverside, graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I'm actively seeking out internship positions or careers which pertain to my field of study. I have experience and interest in software development and engineering, data retrieval and analysis, artifical intelligence and machine learning, and more.

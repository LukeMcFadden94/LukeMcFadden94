Greetings!

I host my projects here, some of wich are finished and others are a work in progress.

I'm currently a Computer Science student attending University of California, Riverside, with a anticipated graduation date of Fall 2021. I'm actively seeking out internship positions or careers which pertain to my field of study. I have experience and interest in software development and engineering, data retrieval and analysis, artifical intelligence and machine learning, and more.
